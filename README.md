##Form Client
 
Please fork this repo, commit your code, push and then let James (james@showgizmo.com) know.
 
We would like you to:
 
1. Create a mobile-friendly HTML page with a form
    - what data the form collects does not really matter
 
2. Write some code in your language or framework of choice that will submit form data via AJAX
    - the endpoint to post to is https://web-dev-test.herokuapp.com/forms
    - the form data should be JSON-encoded and structured like { "form": { "your data here" } }
    
3. Display the response in mobile-friendly HTML page, in human-readable format.

If you have any questions or need clarification about what is required, email James at the above email address.
